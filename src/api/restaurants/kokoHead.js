  description: `Chef Lee Anne Wong’s breakfast congee, koko moco, and daily dumplings are just some examples of her innovative Pan-Asian cuisine. She’s transforming brunch with a creativity that is worth getting on a plane for - you won’t find anything quite like Koko Head Cafe on the mainland. The cafe’s interior is simple and unpretentious Hawaiian beach style meets small-town diner. You’ll need to reserve your table at least a week in advance.
