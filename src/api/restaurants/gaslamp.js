  description:
    `This dimly-lit speakeasy is a gem hiding behind beloved dive Kailua Town Pub. Kailua is a small town with a population of about 40,000, but Gaslamp could easily compete with Honolulu’s swanky restaurants. Come for the cocktails, stay for The Yacht - an impressive shellfish tower of Alaskan king crab, oysters, Argentinian prawns, Caribbean lobster tails, Norwegian langoustines, and Hawaiian ahi poké. You have to make reservations at least a week in advance because space is limited (and there's a dress code, too).`,
