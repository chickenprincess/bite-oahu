  description: `Chef Maii was born and raised in Honolulu but she honed her culinary skills in New York City - her restaurant touts itself as a "hapa" Brooklyn/Honolulu experience of New American cuisine. Fete is located in one of Chinatownâ€™s historic brick buildings, and its local vintage vibes are sophisticated but not pretentious. Aloha shirts and casual summer dresses are standard attire. We recommend their sandwiches for lunch, or a cocktail & main entree pairing for dinner.
