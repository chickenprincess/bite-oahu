  "description": "This place is BYOB, which is fun. Make reservations online, they have limited seating due to Covid. The food here is non-traditional Korean - they pull inspiration from local flavors and the result is some of the most interesting food we've ever had. The location is interesting, too, the restaurant is in Chinatown but they have a back patio. In addition to their core menu, they do monthly specials.",
