  description:
    `O'Kim’s is an adventurous choice for non-traditional Korean food. O’Kim’s chefs pull inspiration from local dishes and the result is some of the most interesting and inventive food we had on the island. In addition to their core menu, O’Kim’s does monthly specials and they are BYOB, which is fun. Ask for seats on their backyard patio.`,
