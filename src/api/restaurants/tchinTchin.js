  description:
    `You'll find most of Oahu's historic architecture in Chinatown, which is home to rows of brick buildings built in the 1900s. The area recently experienced a cultural revival and you can now visit a coffee shop, art gallery, and a Chinese herbalist on the same block. There are many fabulous bars and restaurants in Chinatown, but Tchin Tchin! was our favorite. The interior is elegant, plus they've got an outdoor rooftop space, which is a fun experience in the middle of downtown Honolulu.`,
