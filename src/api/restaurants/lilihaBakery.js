  description:
    "There are over a hundred dining options at pricey Ala Moana, but we think Liliha Bakery is the only place worth visiting for a moderately priced sit-down meal. This location is tucked away on the third floor of Macy's, but the original bakery is famous on the island for its coco puffs (cream puffs filled with chocolate frosting) and malasadas (Portuguese fried donuts).",
