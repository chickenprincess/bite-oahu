    "If you can avoid it, don't go to a restaurant at Ala Moana Shopping Center. The restaurants are overpriced and NOT Covid responsible. If you need a quick bite, we recommmend Brug (another bakery on this list). But if you want a sit-down meal, try Liliha Bakery. This location is in the Ala Moana Macy's, but the original bakery is famous on the island. The food at the adjacent restaurant is okay, but still better than anything else you'll find at the mall. Ruscello is another option (located in the Nordstrom) but we didn't get a chance to try it.",
